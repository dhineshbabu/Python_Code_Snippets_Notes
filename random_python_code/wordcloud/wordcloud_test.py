source_text = "Reporting directly to the Engineering Manager, you will dive in and take ownership of our existing codebase, helping extend and scale our bespoke recommendations engine, order management, inventory, shipping, and reporting components. This is a great opportunity to lead the engineering team of a startup that is already profitable, already a well-known brand for women, but is still growing fast even in COVID times. We need someone who can not only build our existing codebase, but also push the envelope, as we are developing some sophisticated data science capabilities, similar to Netflix, Amazon, and Stitch Fix.Founded in 2014, Nadine West sends personalized outfits to our customersâ€™ doorsteps every month. We are based in Austin TX, but we are a remote-first company, so you can live and work anywhere."
